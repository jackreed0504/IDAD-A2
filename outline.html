        My project for Assignment 2 is an interactive music piece. I have
        responded to the prompt, 'Novel Input', by allowing a user interacting
        with various abstract 3D shapes, such as pillars, diamonds and spheres,
        to control aspects of a music track's mix, such as levels and effects
        like reverb. This encourages the user to engage in play, resulting in a
        fun and experimental experience, and immersing them into the music
        piece. The advanced JavaScript Technique I have used is 'math.random()'.
        I have implemented this by having the snare drum sample change randomly
        whenever the user reloads the page.

      <p>
        The project is mainly inspired by the interactive music piece, Helios by
        Yume. By dragging diamond shapes around different 3D environments, the
        user is able to change aspects of the music, such as changing the levels
        of different instruments, or playing instruments by moving the shapes
        around. I also was inspired by the characterisation, the abstract shapes
        encourage experimentation and play and the vivid colours create a moody
        environment to backdrop the piece. I'm using the idea of interactive
        shapes and moody, playful characterisation in my piece.

        I am also inspired by Holdspace by Carlos Yusim. This interactive music
        piece uses minimal mapping, with the novel input of holding/releasing
        the spacebar to switch between two different music pieces and
        animations. The characterisation reinforces the mood of the piece, with
        a traditionally 'hi-tech' looking wireframe animation reflecting the
        electronic instrumentation of the music. While my piece is quite
        different, I am using interactions to immerse the viewer in the piece in
        my project.
