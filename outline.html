        My project for Assignment 2 is an interactive music piece. I have
        responded to the prompt, 'Novel Input', by allowing a user interacting
        with various abstract 3D shapes, such as pillars, diamonds and spheres,
        to control aspects of a music track's mix, such as levels and effects
        like reverb. This encourages the user to engage in play, resulting in a
        fun and experimental experience, and immersing them into the music
        piece. The advanced JavaScript Technique I have used is 'math.random()'.
        I have implemented this by having the snare drum sample change randomly
        whenever the user reloads the page.

        The project was mainly inspired by the interactive music piece, Helios
        by Yume. By dragging diamond shapes around different 3D environments,
        the user is able to change aspects of the music, such as changing the
        levels of different instruments, or playing instruments by moving the
        shapes around. I also was inspired by the characterisation, the abstract
        shapes encourage play and the vivid colours
