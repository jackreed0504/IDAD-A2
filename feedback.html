      <h3>Feedback Prompts and reflections:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li class="feedback">
          Is it clear what the effects of each interaction are?
        </li>
        <p>
          Most users seemed to understand the effects of the pillars, but many
          struggled to make out the effects of pressing the diamond or the
          sphere (reverb and delay respectively). I will respond to this by
          making these effects less subtle. Some ways I could try to do this are
          by increasing the wetness of the reverb and delay signals, or by
          changing out the effects for less subtle ones, such as distortion.
        </p>
        <li class="feedback">
          Did you feel like you understood how you were meant to interact with
          the design?
        </li>
        <p>
          Some people seemed to be unsure about how to interact with the site,
          but most users responded that they felt they mostly understood after
          exploring. In this sense, it mostly achieved my intention of
          encouraging play. One user expressed confusion over the functions of
          the diamond and sphere. In response to the previous prompt a user also
          remarked that they didn't understand how to interact with these
          elements. In response to this, I have begun developing visual feedback
          in the form of a glow behind these two objects when they are clicked.
          Another user pointed out that some cursor feedback could help users
          understand how to interact with the objects. While there is already a
          pointer cursor that appears on hover over the diamond and the sphere,
          I could consider adding a "move" cursor on hover over the pillars in
          CSS, making it more clear to the user that they are meant to drag them
          up and down.
        </p>
        <li class="feedback">
          What emotions did the interaction design make you feel?
        </li>
        <p>
          This was a poorly worded prompt on my part, as I was intending to get
          feedback on whether users felt the intentionally vague interaction
          design inspired more curiosity or frustration. Many users used
          adjectives like "calm", "serenity", "dreamy" to describe the work,
          which indicates that the characterisation has achieved my intention of
          creating a moody, evocative backdrop to the music piece. One user did
          respond that they were "intrigued" by the interaction design, which
          was my intention, however they also remarked that the lack of a
          percievable effect of the diamond made them confused. This indicates
          that I need to make the effect of the diamond more clear, possibly
          using the methods I discussed in response to the first prompt.
