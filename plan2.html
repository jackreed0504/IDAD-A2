      <h3>Plan:</h3>
      <p>
        Over Assignment 2 and 3, we are designing and developing an interface
        for an interactive audio project, using the Tone.js framework. For this
        project, I would like to design an interactive music piece, where the
        user can change aspects of the mix by interacting with abstract
        controls.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are given a set of creative prompts to work with for the project:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>No text characters</li>
        <li>All text characters</li>
        <li>Skeuomorphism</li>
        <li>Spacial control</li>
        <li>Novel input</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I plan on choosing the prompt "Novel input". I want to achieve this
        through abstract controls, resembling a an art piece or video game,
        through which the user can interact with the piece.
      </p>
      <p>
        We must also use one of the following JavaScript methods in our project:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Random : Math.random()</li>
        <li>Date/time : Date.now()</li>
        <li>Location : navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I plan on choosing "Date/time", using the time of day to change the
        appearance of the scene.
      </p>

      <h3>Sketches:</h3>
      <img src="assets/inputs.jpg" alt="Sketch of the inputs" />
      <p>
        I wanted to use 3D graphics resembling the artstyle of the video game
        Monument Valley, inspiring play in the viewer. In turn, it also will
        evoke the optically puzzling works of M.C Escher, eliciting
        experimentation from the viewer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rendering 3D graphics in a web project would be hard to achieve in this
        project due to my lack of previous experience with it and the limited
        time available in the assignment. I experimented with creating
        pre-rendered sprites in Blender and implementing them in an interactive
        Figma prototype, to which I acheived a degree of success:
      </p>

      <video src="assets/figmavid.mov" controls></video>

      <p>
        I also wanted to test how much effort it would take to replicate this
        with HTML+CSS+JS, to evaluate whether this was achieveable in the
        timeframe of the assignment:
      </p>

      <video src="assets/htmlvid.mov" controls></video>

      <p>
        This was also somewhat successful. There are some problems I will need
        to solve to have success with this method:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>I need to learn how to limit how far I can drag an item</li>
        <li>
          The shadow for the rightmost pillar is attached to the image. How can
          I make sure this isn't exposed to the viewer?
        </li>
        <li>Dragging the afforementioned shadow moves the "wrong" pillar</li>
        <li>I need to decide whether the pillars are sliders or buttons</li>
      </ul>
    </main>
