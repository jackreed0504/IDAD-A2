      <h3>Plan</h3>
      <p>
        Over Assignment 2 and 3, we are designing and developing an interface
        for an interactive audio project, using the Tone.js framework. For this
        project, I would like to design a sample based drum machine which
        creates "microbeats" using found sounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are given a set of creative prompts to work with for the project:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>No text characters</li>
        <li>All text characters</li>
        <li>Skeuomorphism</li>
        <li>Spacial control</li>
        <li>Novel input</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I plan on choosing the prompt "No text characters". I plan to achieve
        this through symbols and evocative illustrations, encouraging play and
        expression from the user rather than precision.
      </p>
      <p>
        We must also use one of the following JavaScript methods in our project:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Random : Math.random()</li>
        <li>Date/time : Date.now()</li>
        <li>Location : navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I plan on choosing "Math.random()", which I can use to generate
        expressivity and humanity in the beats (the ability to have random pitch
        and velocity can add humanity to the beats). The ability to randomise
        the beats could also be an interesting option to add play to the
        interface.
